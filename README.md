# HP-14-bs727TU-EFI
My Hackintosh EFI file for the HP 14 bs727TU.

This is the EFI file for the HP 14 bs727TU from 2017/18 which I used to successfully boot (up to) Ventura on my device. Keep in mind that the files do not include the WiFi/Bluetooth kext as this device does not have a compatible internet card. I have also removed the HDMI output & USB mapping kext as that might differ across devices, please refer to the [OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).
